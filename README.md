# Node.js Frontend and Backend Build

This GitHub Action simplifies the process of installing Node.js dependencies, building a frontend project, and running tests for both the frontend and backend. It encapsulates all necessary steps into a reusable action, saving you time and effort in setting up your CI/CD pipeline.

## Features

- Installs Node.js dependencies for both frontend and backend projects.
- Builds the frontend project.
- Runs tests for both the frontend and backend.
- Fully configurable to work with custom project directory structures.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use this action in your workflow:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Node.js frontend and backend build
        uses: melvinsamuel070/nodejs-frontend-backend-build@v1
        with:
          frontend_directory: './frontend'
          backend_directory: './backend'
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Inputs**: Specify the directories for your frontend and backend projects.
2. **Script Execution**: The action runs the `npm.sh` script, which performs the following tasks:
   - Updates the system and installs required dependencies (`Node.js`, `npm`, etc.).
   - Installs Node.js dependencies for both frontend and backend projects.
   - Builds the frontend project.
   - Runs tests for both projects.

---

## Requirements

- Your project must have `package.json` files in both the frontend and backend directories.
- Ensure that your test scripts are defined in the `package.json` files for both projects.
